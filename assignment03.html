<H3> INTRODUCTION: </H3>
Hi, I'm Lexy Bloss! I am a sophmore at Juniata College studying business management. My favorite class this semester is 
Microeconomics. I play volleyball at Juniata as well. I hope to own a gym one day, which would create the perfect pairing
between my interests in fitness and business.
