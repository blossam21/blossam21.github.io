<h1>Assignment 03</h1>

<h3>INTRODUCTION:</h3>
Hi, I'm <b>Lexy Bloss</b>! I am a sophmore at Juniata College studying <u>business management</u>. My favorite class this semester is 
<i>Microeconomics</i>. I play volleyball at Juniata as well. I hope to own a gym one day, which would create the perfect pairing 
between my interests in fitness and business. I believe Juniata is the perfect place for me to continue developing into 
the person I wish to be one day.
<h3>OUTLOOK:</h3>
After playing volleyball at Juniata for one full season, I have learned a lot. I have found balance in many aspects of my 
life. I learned how to be a student and develop study skills. I found a new appreciation for embracing the process of getting 
better mentally and physically. I learned how to be confident and take care of myself. If you ask anyone on the volleyball 
team about how my first year went, I am 99% sure they will tell you I struggled. I had to work tirelessly on my volleyball 
skills and life skills. I am a better person because of my struggles. The proof is in my performance now.
